Hey @Early Birds!

I've pushed a new version of the CLI! Getting close to 0.2.0 :partying_face:

Here's the current changelog:

- Bump minimum Dart SDK to 3.3
- Adds extension type support
- Adds `JsonValue` hierarchy for representing JSON primitives safely
- Model/exception types from third-party packages no longer need to be exported from `models.dart`/`exceptions.dart`. Only types you've defined in your backend.
- Adds support for `lib/models/` and `lib/exceptions/` folders for better organization of custom types

**Fixes**
- Allow Object and Object?/dynamic is models, functions and exceptions (#35: https://github.com/celest-dev/celest/issues/35)
- Incompatibility of custom toJson/fromJson with other non-Celest code (#38: https://github.com/celest-dev/celest/issues/38)
- Bug: Custom exception not thrown (#48: https://github.com/celest-dev/celest/issues/48)
- DRY up exception handling in generated client (#49: https://github.com/celest-dev/celest/issues/49)

**Deprecations**
- `lib/models.dart`/`lib/exceptions.dart` have been deprecated in favor of `lib/models/` and `lib/exceptions/` folders
